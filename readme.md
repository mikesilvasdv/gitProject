Hi!

This is my first upload to Git Hub!

I'm learning the basics of Git.

Typing 'git init' on the terminal, it will create an empty repository.

Typing 'git add "thenameofthefile"' it will add my file to the repository.

Typing 'git status' it will show the status of your repository.

Typing 'git commit -m 'theNameOfYourProjectOrFile' it will commit your file to the repository.



Thanks for reading ;)

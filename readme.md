Hi!

This is my first upload to Git Hub!

I'm learning the basics of Git.

Typing 'git init' on the terminal, it will create an empty repository.

Typing 'git add "thenameofthefile"' it will add my file to the repository.

Typing 'git status' it will show the status of your repository.

Typing 'git commit -m 'theNameOfYourProjectOrFile' it will commit your file to the repository.

Typing 'git branch -M 'main' - it will changes the name of the branch.

Typing 'git remote add origin 'https://github.com/mikesilvasdv/gitProject.git' - it will add the origin of your repository.

Typing 'git push -u origin main' - it will upload your repository to Git Hub "i think".



Thanks for reading ;)
